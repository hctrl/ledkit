# ledkit

## a high level framework to render stuff on an LED strip, like a ws2812x

lightweight, but comes with:

- color conversion
- idle animations
- middleware capabilities

core concepts:

- colors are usually in rgb, more specifically an array like [r, g, b] with values from 0 to 255

todo:

- [ ] infer type of the render function or something
- [ ] yellow doesn't work for some reason
